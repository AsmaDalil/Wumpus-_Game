# Wumpus-_Game
For our second project , My teammate Kenza Rchi and I developed an intelligent agent to 
find solution for different states of the game Wumpus World. The game focus on an agent 
that is trying to explore a four-by-four layout of rooms in order to kill a wumpus. the main 
purpose of the game for the agent is to shoot the wumpus. During teh process of finding teh 
wumpus, the agent will try to get gold to increase the score with a 1000 and to avoid avoid
the pits in the rooms using its senses.
To acheive the purpose of the game, we used Prolog in order to implement the game as well 
as all the inference rule
